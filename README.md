# To-Do List Application

## 🚀 Overview

I’m excited to share my latest project, a feature-rich To-Do List application built with React! This project includes a range of features and technologies to manage tasks efficiently with a modern and responsive UI.

## 🔍 Features

- **State Management & Effects:** Utilizes `useState`, `useRef`, and `useEffect` for managing application state and lifecycle events.
- **Context API:** Leverages React’s Context API to handle alerts and task management effectively.
- **Material-UI Integration:** Designed with Material-UI components for a sleek and responsive user interface.
- **Custom Animations:** Incorporates a loading animation using a video for a smooth user experience.
- **Local Storage Persistence:** Saves tasks in local storage to ensure data persistence across sessions.
- **Reducer Pattern:** Implements a reducer to manage task-related actions, providing clear and maintainable state management.
