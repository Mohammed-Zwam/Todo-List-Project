# To-Do List Application

## 🚀 Overview

I’m excited to share my latest project, a feature-rich To-Do List application built with React! This project includes a range of features and technologies to manage tasks efficiently with a modern and responsive UI.

## 🔍 Features

- **State Management & Effects:** Utilizes `useState`, `useRef`, and `useEffect` for managing application state and lifecycle events.
- **Context API:** Leverages React’s Context API to handle alerts and task management effectively.
- **Material-UI Integration:** Designed with Material-UI components for a sleek and responsive user interface.
- **Custom Animations:** Incorporates a loading animation using a video for a smooth user experience.
- **Local Storage Persistence:** Saves tasks in local storage to ensure data persistence across sessions.
- **Reducer Pattern:** Implements a reducer to manage task-related actions, providing clear and maintainable state management.

## 📦 Usage

### Add Tasks

Click on the “Add Task” button to create new tasks. A popup or input field will appear where you can enter the task details and then save them.

### Edit Tasks

To edit a task, click on the task you want to modify. This will open an edit popup or form where you can update the task details. Save the changes to update the task.

### Delete Tasks

To delete a task, use the delete option provided in the popup or task menu. A confirmation dialog will appear to ensure you want to remove the task. Confirm the deletion to remove the task from the list.

### View Tasks

The main interface displays an overview of all tasks. You can see the list of tasks and use the available options to manage them, including adding, editing, or deleting tasks.
